# <p align="center"> Project Description: Sales and Customer Analysis üõçÔ∏èüìà</p>
This repository contains SQL scripts for a Sales and Customer Analysis project. The project focuses on leveraging a relational database to gain insights into purchasing patterns, and product performance. The database schema, data insertion, and analytical queries are all defined within the provided SQL files.

## üöÄ **Key Features**
* **Database Schema Creation** (`create_database.sql`): This script sets up a normalized database schema consisting of four tables:
  * `customers`: Stores demographic information, such as age, gender, location, and income.
  * `customer_purchase_history`: Records transaction details like product category, brand, and order value.
  * `customer_reviews`: Stores customer feedback and ratings.
```mysql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS sales_analysis;
CREATE DATABASE sales_analysis;

USE sales_analysis;

-- Table 1: customers
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers;
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    age INT,
    gender VARCHAR(50),
    location VARCHAR(255),
    education VARCHAR(255),
    income DECIMAL(10 , 2 ),
    channel_preference VARCHAR(255),
    lifecycle_stage VARCHAR(255),
    PRIMARY KEY (customer_id)
);

-- Table 2: customer_purchase_history
CREATE TABLE customer_purchase_history (
    purchase_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    product_category VARCHAR(255),
    brand VARCHAR(255),
    order_value DECIMAL(10 , 2 ),
    PRIMARY KEY (purchase_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
        REFERENCES customers (customer_id)
);

-- Table 3: customer_reviews
CREATE TABLE customer_reviews (
    review_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
    purchase_id INT NOT NULL,
    rating INT,
    review_text TEXT,
    review_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
        REFERENCES customers (customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (purchase_id)
        REFERENCES customer_purchase_history (purchase_id)
);
```

* **Business Insights** (`insights.sql`): This script contains a series of analytical queries designed to extract valuable business insights. These queries can be used to inform marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and optimize product offerings. The insights generated include:
  * **Identifying Most Valuable Customers:** Ranks customers by their total purchase value.
  * **Analyzing Product Popularity:** Determines the most popular product categories for different age groups.
  * **Customer Engagement Metrics:** Identifies customers with the highest number of purchases.
  * **Product Performance Evaluation:** Calculates the average customer rating for each product category.
